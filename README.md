## OMDb (Open Movie Database) API Project

This program enables the user to search for various movies, series or episodes using the
‘OMDb (Open Movie Database) API. The user is presented with different navigation options
and receives information in an interactive manner in order to minimise user error. When the
user enters a title, the program first confirms the title exists on the OMDDb, and then displays
all relevant information for the entry. At the same time, the title of the search is written to a
textfile 'Search History', which contains all titles from previous searches. Additionally, all
information from each previously searched title is also written to a textfile 'Last Searched’, so
that information for all previous searches can also be viewed. After a navigation option is
selected and enacted, the user is again presented with the other navigation options so they
may choose to search another title, view previous search information, or exit. Step by step
information is provided for the user once the program is run in an attempt to minimise user
error.

### The code of the program includes the following sections:
- Importing libraries
- Declaring and initialising variables
- Opening text files
- Defining functions
- Checking the status of the API connection
- Navigation
- Main code
