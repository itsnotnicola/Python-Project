    "This program enables the user to search for various movies, series or episodes using the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API. The user is presented with different navigation options and receives information in an interactive manner in order to minimise user error. When the user enters a title, the program first confirms the title exists on the OMDb, and then displays all relevant information for the entry. At the same time, the title of the search is written to a textfile 'Search History', which contains all titles from previous searches. Additionally, all information from each previously searched title is also written to a textfile 'Last Searched', so that information for all previous searches can also be viewed. After a navigation option is selected and enacted, the user is again presented with the other navigation options so they may choose to search another title, view previous search information, or exit. Step by step information is provided for the user once the program is run in an attempt to minimise user error."

    "This program includes many key design decisions. These include the use of functions to incorporate the main features of the program as well the decision to base the program on a selection based navigation system, due to the lack of GUI. Additionally, formatting the output data in a neat, coherent manner was a priority- and many design decisions were made with that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Use of Functions for Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially opted not to use a funcion for the section of code now defined under the search_title function, and instead wrote the code where it was applicable to the navigation choice made. However, as I incorperated more options through the navigation options, I realised the best decision would be for the search_title process to be a function. This was due to factors such as the need for the action to be recalled multiple times throughout the code, as well as the amount of lines of code required for the action and the time it took to develop the action and get it working correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once I realised the effectiveness of the search_title function and the ways it improved the coding of the overall program, it became clear that the view_df process would also be most useful as a function for the same factors: it's need to be called in multiple instances throughout the code due to the nature of the navigation system used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Use of a Navigation System as a Key Design Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to my previous coding experience in Pascal, I was accustomed to utilising a GUI to get input from the user. This influenced my decision to use a numbered navigation system for this project, as I wanted the user to have different options for input that the program would be able to interpret in a specific way with minimal user error. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the navigation system does have a few functional issues. Due to the different navigational branches the user is able to choose, and the lack of a GUI, the navigation options don't always link back to the three main options presented to the user throughout the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Enter a title to search for\n",
    "2: View previous search information\n",
    "3: Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted the navigation system to always link back to these three options no matter which of the first two options were selected. Unfortunately, between trying to catch user errors with try except statements and accounting for user choice, this became difficult to keep up with. While I did use loops in many of these instances in an attempt to keep the navigation as cohesive as possible, the limited options for the project interface hindered this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Format of the Output Data as a Key Design Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the project scope and the requirement of various forms of text output such as a text file, I decideded I wanted to prioritise the neat-ness and and organisation of the output. I did this through utilising '\\n' for adding a new line and '\\t' for tab, which made the text output easier to read with the limited formatting options available. This is demonstrated by the code excerpt below:\n"

The program then repeats the original naviagtion options.\n",

    "Here the first if statement of the code excerpt is encountered. It's purpose is to also catch errors of invalid input. For example, entering the number 4 would not invoke a ValueError in the try except statement, as 4 is an acceptable integer and not any kind of string or char. However, 4 is not a valid naviagtional option presented to the user. The if statement therefore checks that the integer the user enters is within the range of navigational choices, 1-3, and if it is not, the boolean variable validSelection is set from True to false and the following while loop which uses validSelection as its conditional is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop first alert's the user through a print statement that their input is again invalid, and to please make a valid selection and press 'n' to continue. The whie loop then asks the user to again enter their navigational selection. This is followed by an if statement which requires the conditions that the choice variable from the user's input either be equal to 1,2 or 3 to be valid. If the choice variable is equal to 1,2 or 3, the boolean variable validSelection is set to True and the while loop ends due to the change in conditional. \n",

    "The program initially seemed quite straight forward and I didn't encounter any major errors that stopped the program from running that I felt I wouldn't be able to figure out, or sit with for over a few hours. My main issues were trying to make the navigational options as efficient as possible and ensuring the user input valid data. Aside from the text file issue I describe below, coding the program and making improvments as I progressed through it was swift. The biggest aspect of this was restructuring the code after over half the program was completed to rework the functions which overall made the code easier to work with, more efficient and less cumbersome. \n",

However any errors I encountered merely made me more familiar with the workings and details of these libraries, especially pandas as I opted to add an extra feature to my program using a dataframe. \n",

    "I did encounter a few problems while coding this project. These were mainly due to the limited nature of the navigational system and the limited way in which data could be collected from the user, as well as processing the direct output from the OMDb itself into a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Navigation System\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the navigational system used would always return to a kind of 'home screen', in which the three main appropriate navigational features would always be returned to at the end of a different navigational selection. This would entail this 'home screen' being shown after the user has searched for their desired title, or viewed the previous information available or search another title. However, this constant return to 3 options became tricky to code due to the never ending possibilities of which combination of navigational choices the user could opt for, as well as the lack of a comprehensive GUI which would present more options. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it was possible to achieve this to an extent. However, the amount of while loops, if statements, nested loops, nested if statements, nested try except statements, and normal try except statements started to become cluttered and confusing to follow, all on the small chance the user would want to repeat certain navigational options in a certain order. While I'm sure there was a more comprehensive and efficent way to achieve this kind of 'home screen' system, I decided due to time constraints that mine was comprehenisve enough for the scope of the project and the user's intentions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using functions for the key design decisions did remedy this to an extent, and I beleive the use of Object Orientated Coding could have assisted as well. But again, unfortunately due to time constratints I did not have enough time left to completely redeisgn my program based around these revelations, and instead implemented them as much as I could, to a reasonable degree which I beleved would help the functionality of the navigational system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of GUI, I found it difficult collecting data from the user solely through the input function. This meant requesting any information from the user one line at a time and only being able to flag the input data as invalid once it could be processed through the code. This would have been much easier with a comprehenisve GUI which allowed multiple types of input data for different parameters through features such as text boxes, input boxes, or multi select boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Text File Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the biggest issue I encountered, as I simply did not have the depth of knowledge required to prevent it from happening, but understoof how to reset it each time it happened. I also struggled to find any internet resources on the matter which was in the scope of my understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to certain characters in the data output by OMDb, such as '/' or '-', the text file I used to keep track of information from previously searched titless kept encoding itself into a format Jupyter Notebook could not work with. Jupyter Notebook apparently requires textfiles to be 'UTF-8' encoded, a format which apparently did not support the use of characters such as '/' or '-'. Now each time the text file changed to 'ANSI' encoding to cope with the characters from the OMDb output, Jupyter Notebook was unable to work with it. I could fix this through opening the text file in my laptop Notepad and resaving it as 'UTF-8' encoded, and thus reaccess the information of the previously searched titles, however I was unable to find a way to stop the text file from becoming 'ANSI' encoded in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I researched the matter heavily and did attempt to remedy it by specifying the text file should be 'UTF-8' encoded when the file was opened, but I still occassionally encountered the problem and the text file would then be unreadable by Jupyter Notebook until resaved as 'UTF-8' encoded."

The default text file viewer should ask whether you would like to overwrite the previosuly existing text file, to which the answer is yes. This will ensure no data is lost from the text file of previous searches due to the encoding issues present.\n",
